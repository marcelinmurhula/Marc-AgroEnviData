# Project Title: Time Series Analysis of Carbon Emissions

## Description
This project was undertaken to practice and explore the power of Python in data science by analyzing carbon emissions data over time. The goal was to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies, as well as to develop forecasting models. The analysis includes time series decomposition, correlation analysis, forecasting, clustering, and anomaly detection. "Carbon emissions dataset" is the dataset used that came from Kaggle.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes monthly carbon emissions data measured in million metric tons. The data is sourced from [source name] and covers the period from [start date] to [end date]. 

## Analysis
1. **Time Series Analysis:** Identified trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in carbon emissions.
2. **Seasonal Decomposition:** Decomposed the time series data to analyze seasonal, trend, and residual components.
3. **Correlation Analysis:** Investigated correlations between carbon emissions and energy consumption.
4. **Forecasting:** Used ARIMA models to predict future carbon emissions.
5. **Clustering:** Applied KMeans clustering to identify similar periods in the data.
6. **Anomaly Detection:** Used Isolation Forest to detect unusual patterns or outliers.

## Results
- Identified an increasing trend in carbon emissions over the analyzed period.
- Found seasonal patterns with peaks and troughs in emissions.
- Discovered significant correlations between carbon emissions and energy consumption.
- Forecasted future emissions with reasonable accuracy using ARIMA models.
- Identified distinct clusters of emission periods.
- Detected anomalies that warrant further investigation.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into the patterns and drivers of carbon emissions. The findings can inform policy decisions and future research efforts. Further analysis could explore additional factors influencing emissions and refine the forecasting models.
